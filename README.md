# MoodSwingWebMockerGUI

**MoodSwingWebMockerGUI** is a playful Java Swing application that lets you interact with a snarky and humorous chatbot. The bot will roast, compliment, or react weirdly to your messages‚Äîand will even taunt you if you stay silent!

## Features

- **Mock, Nice, and Weird Responses:** The bot randomly switches moods between mockery, encouragement, and complete nonsense.
- **Idle Insults:** If you don‚Äôt type anything for a few seconds, expect a cheeky taunt.
- **Center-Aligned Cloud Chat Bubbles (optional):** If using the advanced version, messages appear in fun, pastel-colored cloud bubbles.
- **Roast Duel Mode:** Get burned for 30 seconds straight if you dare!

- Java 8 or later
- No additional libraries needed (just standard Java SE/Swing)
